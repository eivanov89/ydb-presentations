People need databases to store their data and persistent queues to transfer their data from one system to another. We’ve united tables and persisted queues within one data platform. Now, you can take your data from a queue, process it, and keep the result in a database within a single transaction. So, your application developers don’t need to think about data inconsistency in cases of connection failures or other errors. 

Elena tells you about an open-source platform called YDB, which allows you to work with tables and queues within a single transaction. Elena walk you through architecture decisions, possible scenarios, and performance aspects of this approach.
